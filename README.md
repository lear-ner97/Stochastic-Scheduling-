# Stochastic-Scheduling-
In this project I implemented a two-stage stochastic scheduling model using integer linear programming. The goal is to  find the optimal schedule of production and loading of goods to the vessels.The random variable is the time of arrival of the vessels.  For ILP I used the Python library PuLP.
