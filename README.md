# Stochastic-Scheduling-
In this project I implemented a two-stage stochastic scheduling model using integer linear programming. The goal is to  find the optimal schedule of production and loading of goods.The random variable is the time of arrival of the transporters.  For ILP implementation I used the Python library PuLP.
